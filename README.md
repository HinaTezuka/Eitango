# Automated Tool for English Words and Idioms Memorization
### Overview
As part of my daily hobby of learning languages, especially English, I constantly come across new words. Whenever I encounter unfamiliar words or phrases, I add them to a vocabulary list so that I can review them later. However, this process can be quite tedious.

To make things easier, I developed a system that automatically creates a CSV-format vocabulary list on my desktop whenever I input an unknown word into the terminal.

Additionally, I implemented a feature using the LINE Notify API that sends two quiz questions from the vocabulary list to my LINE account at a set time every day. If I donâ€™t know the meaning of a word, the message also includes a URL linking to the relevant page on Weblio, an online English-Japanese dictionary.
